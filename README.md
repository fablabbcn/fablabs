## This is the official repository for fablabs.io platform project.

Fab labs provide widespread access to modern means for invention. They began as an outreach project from MITâ€™s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), and became into a collaborative and global network. You can find more information about Fab Labs on the [Fab Foundation Website](http://www.fabfoundation.org/).

If you are a Fab labs entusiast and/or you would like to contribute to the project please feel free to get in touch by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fablabbcn/fablabs/issues/new).


## Getting started

### Local development

1. `bower install`

1. `rake db:setup`

1. `rails s`

1. Add this to your `/etc/hosts`:

    `127.0.0.1   www.fablabs.local`
    `127.0.0.1   api.fablabs.local`

1. Visit [http://www.fablabs.local:3000](http://www.fablabs.local:3000)

### Tests

Run tests with:

`bundle exec rake`


### Starting with docker-compose

1. Add all the secrets to an `.env` file - Minimum example is in the `env.example` file

1. Also copy `cp config/application.example.yml config/application.yml`


1. Start the project:

   `docker-compose up web app`

1. Create database (only the first time):

   `docker-compose exec app rake db:setup`

   If bower does not successfully install do:

   `docker-compose exec app /usr/local/bin/bower install`

1. Add this to your `/etc/hosts`:

   `127.0.0.1   www.fablabs.local`

   `127.0.0.1   api.fablabs.local`


1. Visit [http://www.fablabs.local:3000](http://www.fablabs.local:3000)

1. API is served on [http://api.fablabs.local:3000](http://api.fablabs.local:3000)

1. Add test users and data with

    `docker-compose exec app rake db:seed`

    This will create a normal user (email=user@user.local, password=password) and an admin user
    (email=admin@admin.local, password=password)

1. Run tests with

   `docker-compose exec app rake db:setup RAILS_ENV=test`

   `docker-compose exec app rake spec`

1. If you make changes to the code, rebuild the app and deploy the new image

   `docker-compose build`

   `docker-compose up -d`

1. Backup your db at any time with the included script:

    ```
    ./scripts/docker-backup-db.sh
    ```

## Production notes

If you are running in production:

- you need to setup the SSL hosts and .env vars from the docker-compose.yml
- you need to run the assets pipeline to update public/assets

`docker-compose exec app bundle exec rake tmp:clear`
`docker-compose exec app bundle exec rake assets:precompile`
`docker-compose restart app`


## Pull requests

All PRs are tested on Travis. Make sure the tests run fine.

## Versioning

Currently using this tool to manually handle versioning: https://github.com/gregorym/bump

Use this command to update the VERSION file + create a git tag

`bump patch --tag`

Then push the git tag with:

`git push --tags`
