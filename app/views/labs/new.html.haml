      %p
        We are in the process of improving the list of Fab Labs and the approval process, which may change in the future. Before adding a Lab sure to read the current approval process guidelines here.
      %ol
        %li
          %strong How does the registration of a new Lab work?
          In order to be listed on FabLabs.io, you have to fill the form below and discuss your ne Lab with 3 Referee Labs that you can choose in the form. Please fill the details of the form below and choose 3 of the Referee Labs available and contact them, they will approve you after you have exchanged more information with them. The list of Referee Labs is limited to some Fab Labs with experience and a history of collaborating with the global Fab Lab Network, at the moment it is not possible to choose Referee Labs outside that list. It's not important that you already know them, it's important that you start a discussion with them. We are doing this so that the connections among the Labs (especially for new Labs) get strengthened.
        %li
          %strong What is the average/ rough time-span for an new Lab to achieve the status of a "Fab Lab" on the list?
          Referee Labs might be busy, so it depends also on their time. Please do not forget that being listed on FabLabs.io is not the only thing that makes your lab a Fab Lab, you need to interact with the global Fab Lab network continuously and not only when creating the application.
        %li
          %strong Are there multiple stages to complete the registration?
          For the moment the process is simple, the important thing is to get in contact with the 3 Referee Labs you choose.
        %li
          %strong What can I do if I have problems with the registration process?
          %p
